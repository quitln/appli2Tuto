	<p>The displacement of kelp forests could push a unique fauna back to the High Arctic. Algae living under the ice will have nowhere to go and risk disappearing
completely. Kelp species from more temperate regions could replace endemic arctic recurs such as Laminaria solidungula. Ships from a
all over the world sail in the arctic, and they have occasionally taken aquatic stowaways in Rotterdam, Hamburg, Dunkirk or elsewhere. Some change
animals - some of which are too small to be visible to the naked eye - hide in the water of
ballast pumped into tanks to stabilize the vessel. They can also be attached to the hull
and other exterior surfaces, causing what is called "biofouling
". Some survive the journey to the Arctic and are released into the environment during the
ballast water and cargo loading. Those who remain clinging to
the shell can release eggs, sperm or larvae.
