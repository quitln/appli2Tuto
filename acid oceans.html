	<p>The danger of acidic oceans
The tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean are home to more than 75% of the planet's link coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef and more isolated reefs in the Triangle of
Coral, like those from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Coral reefs suffer
the full force of climate change. There is a lot of talk about the damage to these ecosystems caused by coral bleaching, but another insidious phenomenon, the acidification of
the ocean also threatens the survival of reefs. This acidification more notably affects the waters
shallow, and the subarctic Pacific region is particularly vulnerable. Reefs
corals cover less than 0.5% of the planet's surface, but they are estimated to be home to 25
% of all marine species. Due to ocean acidification and other threats,
these "submarine tropical forests" with incredible biodiversity are among the most
most threatened.
